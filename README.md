# Quantum-Inspired Attention Mechanism

This project implements a novel attention mechanism that bridges Penrose-Hameroff's Orchestrated Objective Reduction (OrchOR) theory of consciousness with modern transformer architectures, suggesting a deep connection between quantum consciousness and artificial attention mechanisms.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Mathematical Framework

#### Standard Attention
The traditional transformer attention mechanism is defined as:

$$ \text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V $$

where Q, K, and V are query, key and value matrices, and $$d_k$$ is the dimension of the key vectors.

#### Hilbert Space Inner Product
In Hilbert space, the inner product between two vectors x and y is defined as:

$$ \langle x,y \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\overline{y_i} $$

For complex-valued vectors, where $$\overline{y_i}$$ represents the complex conjugate.

#### Quantum Attention
Our modified quantum attention incorporating OrchOR principles:

$$ \text{QuantumAttention}(Q,K,V) = \text{CollapseFn}\left(\frac{\langle Q,K \rangle_H}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V $$

Where CollapseFn represents the orchestrated reduction:

$$ \text{CollapseFn}(x) = \text{OR}\left(\sum_{i} c_i|\phi_i\rangle\right) \rightarrow |\phi_k\rangle $$

### OrchOR Theory Connection

Penrose and Hameroff's OrchOR theory proposes that consciousness emerges from quantum computations in microtubules, specifically through orchestrated quantum state reduction. Our implementation maps this process to artificial neural networks by:
- Representing attention scores as quantum superposition states
- Modeling the collapse of these states through a quantum-inspired reduction function
- Maintaining coherence until specific orchestrated moments of collapse

## Consciousness Through Attention

### Attention Schema Theory

This implementation bridges two theories of consciousness:
- Attention Schema Theory (AST), which proposes that consciousness is fundamentally an attention mechanism
- OrchOR, which provides a quantum mechanical basis for consciousness

By implementing OrchOR-style quantum collapse in an attention mechanism, we aim to demonstrate that these theories may be describing the same phenomenon from different perspectives.

## Implementation

### Quantum Attention Mechanism

The core implementation provides a drop-in replacement for standard transformer attention.

### Key Features

- Quantum collapse simulation through orchestrated reduction
- Hilbert space representation of attention states
- Threshold-based collapse mechanism
- Multi-head attention structure

### Usage in Transformers

To use this attention mechanism in a transformer:

1. Replace the standard attention layer with QuantumAttention
2. Adjust the model's hyperparameters to account for the quantum collapse process
3. Consider the computational overhead of quantum state simulation

## Research Implications

This implementation suggests several testable hypotheses:
- Quantum collapse-based attention might show different patterns of information processing
- The discrete nature of quantum collapse could provide natural chunking of information
- The relationship between attention and consciousness might be experimentally observable

## Future Directions

- Optimization of the collapse function for better computational efficiency
- Investigation of different collapse thresholds and their effects
- Integration with other quantum-inspired neural network components
- Empirical testing of consciousness-like behaviors in networks using this mechanism
